# 🚀 Welcome to the Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!

Hey future developers! 👋 We’re thrilled to kick off this 30-Day Challenge where you’ll gain practical, job-ready skills by building a complete full-stack Student Management Web Application.

## What to Expect
Over the next 30 days, you’ll learn essential frontend and backend development skills. Each week, we’ll focus on a new phase of the project, covering:

1. **Frontend Basics**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the application interface.
2. **Backend Fundamentals**: Setting up a server with Node.js and Express.
3. **Database Integration**: Using MongoDB to store and manage data.
4. **Deployment and Portfolio Building**: Making your project live and creating a standout GitHub portfolio.

By the end, you’ll have a fully functional project to showcase to potential employers and add to your portfolio. Plus, completing the challenge will qualify you for our **7-Day Internship Challenge**—an opportunity to win a 3-month internship with Teckas Technologies! 🎉

## How It Works

- **Daily Tasks**: Each day, we’ll share a task that builds a specific part of the project. We’ll cover both the “how” and the “why” of each step.
- **Weekly Check-Ins**: At the end of each week, we’ll recap, troubleshoot, and celebrate progress together.
- **Community Support**: Use the comments to share your work, ask questions, and connect with others.

## Let’s Get Started!
Stay tuned for **Day 1’s post**, and let’s make this journey toward job readiness an incredible one.

Welcome aboard, future devs! 🌟
