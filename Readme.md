# Day 8: JavaScript Event Listeners + Data Handling

Welcome to Day 8 of the **Job-Ready Devs 30-Day Challenge!** ðŸš€ Today, weâ€™ll focus on enhancing the interactivity of your **Student Management App** by leveraging JavaScript event listeners. By dynamically handling form actions like submitting and resetting, youâ€™ll create a more user-friendly experience that feels polished and professional.

## Overview
In this lesson, youâ€™ll:

1. Master JavaScript event listeners: Learn how to capture and respond to user actions.
2. Improve form functionality: Add feedback messages to enhance user experience.
3. Handle data dynamically: Ensure smooth form interactions with submit and reset buttons.
Why it matters: Interactive forms are at the heart of almost every modern web application. Understanding event handling is essential for building responsive, user-centric interfaces.

## Objectives
1. Use JavaScript event listeners to handle form actions dynamically.
2. Capture user input using the submit button and provide success feedback.
3. Implement a reset button to clear form data with confirmation prompts.

## Steps
### Step 1: Add a Reset Button to the Form
1. Switch to the "Day-8" Branch
    - Switch to the "Day-8" branch by running the following command in the terminal
    ```bash
     git checkout Day-8
    ```
2. Open your `index.html` file.
3. Add a reset button below the submit button:
    ```html
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
    ```
    - What it does: A reset button clears all input fields in the form to their initial values.

3. Save the file and refresh your browser to ensure the reset button is visible in your form.

### Step 2: Enhance the Submit Button Functionality
1. Open your `script.js` file.
2. Modify the formâ€™s submit event listener to display a success message after adding a student:
    ```javascript
    form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission behavior

    const name = nameInput.value.trim();
    const email = emailInput.value.trim();

    if (!name || !email) {
        alert('Please fill out both fields!');
        return;
    }

    // Add the new student to the list
    addStudent(name, email);

    // Display a success message
    alert('Student added successfully!');

    // Clear the input fields
    nameInput.value = '';
    emailInput.value = '';
    });
    ```

3. Save the file and test:
    - Open the app in your browser.
    - Add a student using the form, and verify that the success message appears.
    Why itâ€™s important: Providing feedback to users after they take an action (e.g., submitting a form) is crucial for improving user experience and maintaining clarity.

### Step 3: Add an Event Listener for the Reset Button
1. Open your `script.js` file.
2. Add an event listener to the reset button to display a confirmation prompt before clearing the form:
    ```javascript
    const resetButton = document.querySelector('button[type="reset"]');

    resetButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        const confirmation = confirm('Are you sure you want to clear the form?');
        if (!confirmation) {
            // Prevent the reset if the user cancels
            event.preventDefault();
        }
    });
    ```

3. Save the file and test:
    - Open the app in your browser.
    - Click the reset button and observe the confirmation prompt.
    - If you confirm, the form will clear; if you cancel, the form remains unchanged.
    Why itâ€™s useful: Confirmations help prevent accidental data loss, ensuring a smoother and more predictable user experience.

## Push Your Changes to GitHub
Follow these steps to save your progress:

  1. **Stage the changes**:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
  2. **Commit the changes with a descriptive message**:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add functions for dynamic student list rendering"
     ```
  3. **Push the changes to your GitHub repository**:
     ```bash
     git push origin Day-8
     ```
